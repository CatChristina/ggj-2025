# Economic Bubble Simulator
A game that myself and Marley made for the Global Games Jam 2025, the theme of the jam was 'bubble'. So we decided to make a game around economic bubbles. It is a satirical UI game where the objective is to make as much money as possible by 2011 and before the economic crashes of 2000 and 2008.

You can download it from the releases or play it online: https://marley2500.itch.io/economic-bubble-simulator
